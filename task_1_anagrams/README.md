Task 1 - Anagrams

Write an application that reverses all the words of input text: 
    
    Example "abcd efgh" => "dcba hgfe" 

    All non-letter symbols should stay on the same places:

    Example "a1bcd efg!h" => "d1cba hgf!e" 

    Use Latin alphabet for test only.

    You should write a function which returns reverse text


Use statement "if __name__ ==  '__main__':" as wrapper for printing result of function.
Test strings should be declared in statement "if __name__ ==  '__main__':"
And call function should also be here.
