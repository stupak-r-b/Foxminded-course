# Task Solutions

In this directory, I will push my task solutions. These tasks were assigned during my Foxminded course. Each task aims to enhance my programming skills and understanding of Python.

## Structure

- Each task will have its own directory or file.
- Solutions will be documented clearly for easier understanding.
- Comments will be added to explain the logic behind the code.

Feel free to review and provide feedback on my solutions!
